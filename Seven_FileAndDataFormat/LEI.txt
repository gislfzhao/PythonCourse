Abstract Landscape metrics or indices have been
commonly used for quantifying landscape patterns.
However, most of these indices are generally focused
on simple analysis and description of the character-
ization of the geometric and spatial properties of
categorical map patterns. These indices can hardly
obtain the information about the spatio-temporal
dynamic changes of landscape patterns, especially
when multi-temporal remote sensing data are used. In
this paper, a new landscape index, i.e., landscape
expansion index (LEI), is proposed to solve such
problems. In contrast with conventional landscape
indices which are capable of reflecting the spatial
characteristics for only one single time point, LEI and
its variants can capture the information of the
formation processes of a landscape pattern. This
allows one to quantify the dynamic changes in two or
more time points. These proposed indices have been
applied to the measurement of the urban expansion of
Dongguan in Guangdong province, China, for the
period of 1988–2006. The analysis identifies three
urban growth types, i.e., infilling, edge-expansion and
outlying. A further analysis of different values of LEI
in each period reveals a general temporal transition
between phases of diffusion and coalescence in urban
growth. This implies that the regularity in the
spatiotemporal pattern of urban development in
Dongguan, is consistent with the explanations
according to urban development theories.

Introduction
Landscape patterns are defined as the spatial arrange-
ment of various landscape elements in different size
and shape. The arrangement, which reflects the heter-
ogeneity of landscape, is the result of various ecolog-
ical processes at multiple scales (Bailey and Gatrell
1995; Csillag and Kabos 2002). Landscape patterns
and their dynamic change processes have been the
crucial componentsoflandscapeecology(Formanand
Godron 1986; Turner 1989; Wu and David 2002).

increasing attention in ecological research and the

1991; Cissel et al. 1999; Fu and Chen 2001).
Characterizing a landscape and quantifying its
structural changes has become possible with the
advances in remote sensing and geographic informa-
tion system (GIS) techniques (Forman and Godron

1986). In recent decades, numerous landscape indices
have been developed to quantify landscape structures
and spatial heterogeneity based on landscape compo-
sition and configuration (O’Neill et al. 1988; Turner
and Gardner 1990; Riitters et al. 1995; Matsushitaa
et al. 2006). Theoretically, landscape indices refer to
metrics developed for categorical map patterns. In
other words, landscape indices are algorithms that
quantify specific spatial characteristics of patches,
classes of patches, or entire landscape mosaics. These
indicesoriginatevariouslyfromstatisticalmeasuresof
dispersion (Pielou 1997), information theory (O’Neill
et al. 1988), fractal geometry (Krummel et al. 1987;
Plotnick et al. 1993) and percolation theory (Gardner
etal.1993;Lietal.1996).Mostoftheseindicescanbe
calculated by using landscape analysis packages, such
as FRAGSTATS (McCarigal and Marks 1995).
Landscape indices have become increasingly popular
for quantifying and characterizing various aspects of
observed spatial patterns (Imbernon and Branthomme
2001; Zhang et al. 2006). However, there are some
limitations with the generalization of relationships
betweenlandscapepatternsandtheirchangeprocesses
by using conventional landscape indices. Researchers
use these indices to quantify the geometric and spatial
properties of categorical map patterns, but seldom use
them to obtain the information about the dynamic
change processes of landscape patterns.
Quantifying landscape patterns and their changes
is essential for the monitoring and assessment of
ecological consequences of urbanization (Luck and
Wu 2002). Urban dynamic processes, especially the
tremendous worldwide expansion of urban popula-
tion and urbanized area, have resulted in various
impacts on the structures, functions, and dynamics of
ecological systems at a wide range of scales (Luck
and Wu 2002). Therefore, it is essential to charac-
terize and understand the changing patterns of urban
growth for alleviating these problems. The first step
to understanding the ecology of cities is to adequately
quantify urban patterns and project their spatiotem-
poral dynamics. Remote sensing and GIS techniques
have been widely applied for describing the spatial
structures of urban environments and characterizing
patterns of urban structures (Li and Yeh 1998; Herold
et al. 2003). Recently, the use of landscape indices
has provided a new avenue for describing the spatial
land use heterogeneity and urban morphological
characteristics, and there has been an increasing
interest in applying landscape indices in analyzing
land use dynamics and urban growth processes
(Alberti and Waddell 2000; Herold et al. 2002).
However, there is a general lack of developing
appropriate landscape indices for quantifying urban
dynamics in two or more time points.
This paper develops a new index landscape
expansion index (LEI), for better understanding of
spatio-temporal land use dynamics in fast growing
regions. Its variants, mean expansion index (MEI)
and area-weighted mean expansion index (AWMEI),
are also developed for improving the performance of
urban expansion analysis. It is expected that LEI
and its variants can be used to identify the
expansion types of a certain landscape and its
distribution patterns from multi-temporal remote
sensing data. A fast growing region, Dongguan in
south China, is selected for testing the proposed
metrics.
Spatial modes of landscape expansion
Pattern-process analysis is one of the main threads in
landscape ecological research, which aims at under-
standing the complex relationships between land-
scape patterns and landscape change processes
(Schro¨der and Seppelt 2006). Resulting from inter-
actions among different ecological processes and
natural environments, landscape patterns can affect
ecological processes in multiple ways, while ecolog-
ical processes can facilitate the evolution of land-
scape patterns. One of such important ecological
processes is landscape expansion (including urban
growth, species spreading, desertification, soil ero-
sion, etc.). It involves mainly three types of spatial
pattern (Fig. 1), i.e., infilling, edge-expansion, and
outlying, while other patterns can be regarded as
variants or hybrids of these three basic forms
(Forman 1995; Ellman 1997; Wilson et al. 2003).
An infilling type refers to the one that the gap (or
hole) between old patches or within an old patch is
filled up with the newly grown patch (Fig. 1a).
Forman (1995) discusses edge-expansion type,
defined as a newly grown patch spreading unidirec-
tionally in more or less parallel strips from an edge
(Fig. 1b). If the newly grown patch is found isolated
from the old, then it would be defined as an outlying
type (Fig. 1c).

Landscape expansion index
There are obvious limitations with conventional
landscape indices for analyzing urban expansion in
many fast growing regions. An essential one is that
they can only quantitatively reflect the landscape
patterns and their distribution for one single time
point. Thus, the purpose of the proposed landscape
expansion index (LEI) is to give a deeper insight of
landscape patterns and temporal dynamics. In addition
to identifying the types of landscape expansion, LEI
can also be used to describe the process of landscape
pattern changes within two or more time points.
LEI is defined by using the buffer analysis, which
is one of the most important spatial analysis functions
of GIS. The buffers are the zones with specified
distances around a target geographical feature. The
analysis can be used in queries to determine which
entities occur either within or outside the defined
buffer zone. Figure 1 illustrates the buffer zone of
new patches with respect to three typical expansion
forms mentioned above. A set of rules are heuristi-
cally proposed for identifying these growth patterns:
(1) if a newly grown patch belongs to the infilling
type growth, the buffer zone is mostly occupied by
the old patch (Fig. 1a); (2) if the newly grown patch
is the edge-expansion type, the area in buffer zone is
mixed by vacant land (or other landscapes) and the
old landscape (Fig. 1b); (3) if the newly grown patch
belongs to the outlying type growth, its buffer zone is
composed exclusively of vacant land (Fig. 1c).
In short, the LEI for a new patch can be defined
and calculated through examining the characteristics
of its buffer zone:
LEI ¼ 100 ?
A o
A o þ A v
ð1Þ
where LEI is the landscape expansion index for a
newly grown patch, A o is the intersection between the
buffer zone and the occupied category, A v is the
intersection between the buffer zone and the vacant
category.
According to this definition, the value of LEI
varies in the range of 0 B LEI B 100. For example,
suppose the occupied category in buffer zone shown
in Fig. 1b has an area of 35, the vacant category in
the buffer zone has an area of 45, then the LEI for the
new patch in Fig. 1b is 100 ?
35
35þ45
¼ 43:75. Simi-
larly, the LEI for the new patch in Fig. 1a results 100,
and becomes 0 in Fig. 1c.
The indicator of LEI can be used for interpretation
oflandscapeexpansion types.Asdescribedearlierthat
there are three major expansion types, it’s straightfor-
ward to divide the whole range of LEI value into three
discrete intervals to respectively represent these three
types. Xu et al. (2007) used a threshold value of ratio
between common edge (between existing and new
urban patches) and patch perimeter to distinguish the
urban expansion types. An expansion type isidentified
asinfillingwhenthevalueofratioislargerthan0.5.An
edge-expansiongrowthischaracterizedbythevalueof
ratiobetweencommonedgeandpatchperimeterbeing
no more than 0.5. So, in this paper, an infill growth is
defined by the area in buffer zone being occupied by
old patch (A o ) at least 50% (Fig. 2a). An edge-
expansiongrowthischaracterizedbytheareainbuffer
zone being occupied by old patch (A o ) no more than
50% (Fig. 2b). Outlying growth is defined by a change
from vacant land to newly grown patch occurring
beyond existing old patch (Fig. 1c). So, if the LEI
value of a new patch ranges (50, 100), then it will be
assigned as the infilling type; if it ranges (0, 50), then
the new patch will be defined as the edge-expansion
type; and the new patch will be classified as the
outlying type once its LEI value equals 0.
In many applications, the primary interest is in the
pattern of the entire landscape mosaic. So, we
proposed a variant of LEI at landscape level, called

mean expansion index (MEI). MEI is integrated LEI
of all patches over the full extent of the data by
simple averaging. It is used to reflect the aggregate
properties of the patch mosaic. MEI is defined by
using the following equation:
MEI ¼
X
N
i¼1
LEI i
N
ð2Þ
where LEI i is the LEI for a new patch, and N is the
total number of newly grown patches. A larger MEI
value signals a more substantial compacting trend
along with the landscape expansion.
An area-weighted mean expansion index (AW-
MEI) is further proposed by considering the weight of
area for each patch. AWMEI is computed simply as
area-weighted mean LEI. This weighted index equals
to the sum, across all patches of LEI value multiplied
by the proportional abundance of the patch. AWMEI
can be defined as follows:
AWMEI ¼
X
N
i¼1
LEI i ? ð a i
A Þ
ð3Þ
where LEI i is the LEI for a newly gorwn patch, a i is
the area of this new patch, and A is the total area of all
these newly grown patches. If the landscape expan-
sion tends to be more compact, the area-weighted
mean expansion index (AWMEI) will be larger. If the
trend of landscape expansion is in a diffusion process,
the vale of AWMEI will be smaller.
Study area and data processing
This paper aims to investigate the dynamics of
landscape expansion using this innovative index LEI
and itsvariants. Bytaking urban growthas anexample
of landscape expansion, these indices are used to
identify the spatial modes of urban expansion. Three
urban growth types will be identified: infilling, edge-
expansion and outlying growth. These indices are
appliedtothepatternanalysisoftheurbanlandscapein
Dongguan,afastgrowingcityintheeastofPearlRiver
Delta, China (Fig. 3). The city is among the corridor
betweenGuangzhouandShenzhen,withatotalareaof
2,465 km 2 . Its rapid urban expansion is closely asso-
ciated with fast economic growth. A large amount of
agriculturalland hasbeen lostinthisregionbecauseof
rapid urban development and poor land management
(Yeh and Li 1997; Liu et al. 2008). In the period of
1988–2006, the urban area increased dramatically
from 66.7 km 2 in 1988 to 853.2 km 2 in 2006.
TM satellite images in 1988, 1993, 1997, 2001 and
2006 were used to provide the inputs to the analysis.
The study area consists of 2,693 9 1,864 pixels, with
a ground resolution of 30 m. The geometric correc-
tion of TM images was carried out by using the PCI
software. The correction was based on the ground
control points (GCPs), which were evenly distributed
over the study area. The correction accuracy was
within 0.5 pixel according to the assessment. The
object-based classification software, eCognition, was
then used for supervised classification of these
images. Accuracy assessment was conducted using
the ground truth data. The classification accuracy was
92.0% for these images. Since the focus of this study
was urban expansion, the land use types were further
converted to only two classes: urban and non-urban.
Application and results
The classification results were further used to extract
the urban areas of Dongguan for four periods, i.e.,

The calculation of the LEI and its variants was
implemented through the programming of Visual
Basic 6.0. Firstly, land use data need to be converted
into the vector format. Then, the buffer zones of all
new patches are generated by executing the program.
Buffers can be set at constant or variable distances
based on feature attributes. In this paper, the buffers
are created by using a constant distance of 1 m. Once
the buffer zones of all growth patches have been
obtained, they are overlaid with the old urban patches
for calculating the area of the old urban patch within
the buffer zones. Lastly, the LEI is calculated for
each new urban patch according to equation (1). The
buffer zones of the new urban patches were auto-
matically generated by the program (Fig. 4); a, b and

c refer respectively to the infilling type, the edge-
expansion type and the outlying type.
The buffer distance may have an effect on the LEI
value. Generally, the buffer distance should be set
roughly equal to or smaller than the spatial resolution
of remotely sensed data. It remains a question whether
the value of LEI would be significantly changed if a
different buffer distance (equal or smaller than 30 m)
is used. In order to examine the effect of the buffer
distance, we use ten different buffer distances to
calculate LEI value. The buffer distance is varied
between 1 and 30 m, i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25
and 30 m. Then, the standard deviation (SD) of LEI
value under different buffer distances for each newly
grown patch is calculated. The standard deviation,
which can provide a way to measure the robustness of
LEI, is defined as follow:
SD i ¼

where SD i is the standard deviation of LEI for the ith

is the number of buffer distance, here M = 10,
^
L i is
the mean LEI value of the ith newly grown patch
under different buffer distance, and L j

represents the
LEI value of the ith newly grown patch with the jth
buffer distance.
Then, the mean SD value of all newly grown
patches is calculated to measure the sensitivity of
buffer distance:
MSD ¼

where N is the total number of new patches.
A smaller MSD value signals a more stable LEI
value under the change of buffer distance. As shown
in Table 1, the values of MSD for four periods with
distances (1 m-5 m) are 0.078 (1988–1993), 0.074
(1993–1997), 0.076 (1997–2001) and 0.069 (2001–
2006), respectively. The values of MSD for four
periods are small, which indicates that the LEI value
change slightly with different buffer distances
(1–5 m). However, the MSD value with distances
(10–30 m) is bigger than the MSD value with
distances (1–5 m). The smaller is the buffer distance,
the more stable of the value of LEI becomes. In this
paper, the buffer distance is set equal to 1 m.

The histograms of LEI for four periods were
produced to perform a quantitative analysis of the
urban growth patterns (Fig. 5). Throughout all of the
period (1988–2006), the value of LEI was in a
decreasing trend. Additionally, Fig. 5 shows an
interesting pattern of the histograms about the
robustness of LEI. Despite the different development
forms in the four periods, three LEI peaks, i.e., [0],
[50–52], and [100], remained quite stable for all
periods. Moreover, the three peaks can provide the
evidence to set the thresholds of LEI values for
determining the urban patch growth types. The
patches within the three LEI peak zones had a
dominant proportion among all the patches, i.e., 66%
(1988–1993), 43% (1993–1997), 34% (1997–2001),
and 37% (2001–2006) respectively for each period
(Table 2). According to the analyses, several thresh-
olds of LEI values were used to determine the urban
patch growth types: (1) 50\LEI B 100, the infilling
type; (2) 0\LEI B 50, the edge-expansion type;
and (3) the outlying type if LEI = 0.
Figure 6 shows the spatial distribution of different
urban growth types in four periods. Three urban patch
growth types were identified by using the proposed
indices. Dramatic changes have occurred for the
urban landscape of Dongguang from 1988 to 2006
because a great amount of agricultural land use has
been transformed into urban land use. However, the
urban landscape shows distinct growth patterns in
different periods. In the first period (1988–1993), the
patterns of urban growth were dominated by the
outlying type (Fig. 6a). New development mainly
took place along the major transportation networks,
exhibiting a disordered and scattered pattern.
Although the infilling-type growth was also identified
in this period, it is much less dominated with some
occasions in the city proper. Similarly, the edge-
expansion-type growth was also less obvious because
it was found mainly around town and district centers.
During the period of 1993–1997, new patches labeled
as outlying were less found while the edge-expan-
sion-type growth took a predominant role (Fig. 6b).
Meanwhile, the infilling-type growth was also inten-
sified around town and district centers. During the
period of 1997–2001, the outlying-type growth was
still in a decreasing trend, and the edge-expansion-
type and the infilling-type growth became dominated
(Fig. 6c). In the last period (2001–2006), a spatial
ring structure was formed in the whole city with a
sequence of land use types. The edge-expansion-type
and the infilling-type growth were still dominated in
the study area. However, the edge-expansion-type
was in a decreasing trend. As a result, the urban
morphology became more compact (Fig. 6d).

The detailed information about the three growth
types was obtained by calculating their total area for
the four periods (Fig. 7). Throughout all of the 18-
year period, the edge-expansion was the primary
growth type except in the period of 1988–1993. In
this period, the outlying type occupied 47% of the
total newly developed urban land, while the infilling
type growth only occupied 9%. The edge-expansion
type accounted for a considerable proportion of 45%.
In the period of 1993–1997, the proportion of the
outlying type dramatically reduced to 14%. In
contrast, there was a tremendous increase of the
proportion of the infilling type (16%) and especially
the edge-expansion type (70%). Between 1997 and
2001, the proportion of the outlying type continu-
ously declined and became least dominated (8%).

The percentage of the edge-expansion type and the
infilling type increased persistently up to 64 and 28%
respectively. In the period of 2001–2006, the situa-
tion had only a trivial change with the result of 8, 63
and 29% for the outlying type, the edge-expansion
type and the infilling type, respectively.
Meanwhile, the number of patches (NP) for the
three urban growth types exhibited some regularity in
the temporal patterns (Fig. 7). The outlying type had
a proportion of 49, 18, 11 and 13% in the four periods
respectively, showing a remarkably decreasing trend.
NP proportion of the edge-expansion type was 38%
in the period 1988–1993. It increased to 57% in the
period 1993–1997 and later decreased gradually to
50% in the period 1993–2006. Joining the edge-
expansion type with an evidently rising trend, the
infilling type had a proportion of 13, 25, 34, and 37%
during the four periods respectively.
To better understand of the morphology and its
development trends of the study area, the mean
expansion index (MEI) and area-weighted mean
expansion index (AWMEI) were calculated for the
growth patterns from 1988 to 2006 based on equation
(3) and (4). As shown in Table 3, the mean expansion
index (MEI) increased from 20.63 in 1988–1993 to
43.83 in 2001–2006. However, it was obviously that
the largest increase was observed during 1988–1997.
This indicates that the urban growth type had
transferred from the outlying to the edge-expansion
in this period. In the period of 1997–2006, MEI
increased slightly (from 41.74 to 43.83), and the
urban growth pattern was quite stable. The area-
weighted mean expansion index (AWMEI) was
13.58, 29.48, 39.30 and 39.53 in the four periods
respectively. The changes of AWMEI values showed
an interesting trend. AWMEI increased dramatically
during the period of 1988–2001, while increased
slightly in 2001–2006. As a whole, the results of MEI
and AWMEI show a clear ascending trend. This
implies that the city tended to be more compact.
Studies have indicated that urban growth manifests
wave-like properties (Blumenfeld 1954; Boyce 1966;
Newling 1969). Dietzel et al. (2005) proposed that the
urban growth process could be described as a general
temporal oscillation between the phases of diffusion
and coalescence based on the theory of urban growth
phases (Cressy 1939; Duncan et al. 1962; Winsbor-
ough 1962). Urban growth can be characterized as
having two distinct processes, diffusion and coales-
cence, with each process following a harmonic
pattern. As shown in Fig. 8, the spatial evolution of
urban areas oscillates between the diffusion and
coalescence of individual urban areas. In the initial
stage, the process starts with the expansion of an
urban seed or core area (Fig. 8a). As the seed grows,
it disperses growth to new development centers or
cores (Fig. 8b), and this diffusive process is compa-
rable to the outlying type growth (Dietzel et al. 2005).
Thereafter, the urban growth is around the periphery
of the initial urban land (Fig. 8c), which is compa-
rable to the edge-expansion type. As the process
continues, urban development would more likely to
take a way of gradually infilling up the gaps among
the existing urban patches, hence the process is
termed coalescence (Fig. 8d).
As shown in Figs. 5, 6 and 7 and Tables 2 and 3,
there are two distinct phases for the rapid urbaniza-
tion process in Dongguan from 1988 to 2006, This is

consistent with the theory of urban growth phases and
the ‘‘diffusion-coalescence’’ model. In 1988, urban
patches were mainly distributed in the city center.
Along with the development of urbanization, more
individual urban development patches are formed,
causing a peak in the number of the outlying type
growth patches. As the values of both MEI and
AWMEI were quite small at the initial period (1988–
1993), the urban development was more regarded as
diffusion, and most of the newly grown patches are
classified as the outlying type. As a result, multiple
new growth centers emerged from these newly
growth patches. As the growth continued, neighbor-
hood patches became increasingly connected because
of the growth mechanism. In the period of 1993–
2006, the edge-expansion type and the infilling type
started to take a more important position in the light
of their enlarging proportions (Fig. 7), and the higher
values of both MEI and AWMEI implied that the
urban development in this period tended to be
‘‘coalesced’’. These evidences prove that the LEI
and their variants proposed in this paper can effec-
tively provide a quantitative analysis of urban
development mechanisms, and thus examine the
theories of urban growth phases.
Conclusions
Although numerous landscape indices have been
proposed on the description or analysis of landscape
patternsforaspecifictimepoint,theycanhardlyreflect
the basic mechanisms governing the process of land-
scape changes. Being the supplement to the conven-
tional landscape indices, the LEI and its variants
proposed in this study are more capable of quantifying
the spatial patterns of landscape expansion within two
or more time points. These proposed indices can
examine the way in which a landscape evolves, and
revealtherelationshipsbetweenthespatialdistribution
of a landscape as well as its evolution process. The
implementation of this model is rather convenient
since the buffer zones of patches can be automatically
delineated by the proposed program.
Urban growth is a sort of critical process from an
ecological point of view. By using the proposed LEI
and its variants, this paper investigates the urban
growth processes in Dongguan for four periods, i.e.,
1988–1993, 1993–1997, 1997–2001 and 2001–2006.
The analyses has demonstrated that the proposed
landscape expansion index (LEI) can be used to
identify various growth types, i.e., infilling, edge-
expansion, and outlying. LEI provides a systematic,
simple, and replicable method that can be use to
describe the urbanization processes in a way that
considers both the amount of changes and the spatial
patterns. The urban development trajectory of Dong-
guan shows different spatial expansion modes during
the whole period. In the initial period of 1988–1993,
the outlying expansion was the dominant growth
type. NP proportion of the outlying type growth
occupied 49% of the total newly developed urban
land, while the infilling type growth only occupied
9%. The edge-expansion type accounted for a con-
siderable proportion of 38%. According to the theory
of urban growth phases, the city in this period is
experiencing the ‘‘diffusion’’ phase. From 1993 to
2006, NP proportion of the outlying type growth
decreased gradually, i.e., 19% (1993–1997), 11%
(1997–2001), 13% (2001–2006), while the edge-
expansion type and the infilling type growth started to
take a more important position in the light of their
enlarging proportions, which implied that the urban
development in this period tends to be the ‘‘coales-
cence’’ phase.
The variants of LEI can provide additional infor-
mation about urban expansion. In the whole period,
the increasingly values of MEI (from 20.63 to 43.83)
and AWMEI (from 13.58 to 39.53) also indicate that
the old scattered and disordered ‘‘diffusion’’ phase

was transformed into a more compact ‘‘coalescence’’
phase based on the development mechanisms.
This study has demonstrated that the processes of
diffusion and coalescence can be clearly identified in
the spatio-temporal development of Dongguan. The
regularity of urban development processes detected
by these indices is consistent with the theories of
urban growth phases. This indicates that LEI and its
variants can become an important tool for capturing
the complex dynamics of urban growth by using
multi-temporal remote sensing data. These indices
can thus provide useful information about the patterns
and change processes of the urban landscapes.
